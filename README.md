# hOCR-to-ALTO
Converts Tesseract's hOCR output to ALTO, for eMOP

This XSLT was developed for eMOP and specifically for converting the output from our [De-noising algorithm](https://github.com/Early-Modern-OCR/hOCR-De-Noising) that works on hOCR output. However, it should be easily tranformable to work on raw hOCR as with a few changes.
